<h1>American Pie</h1>
<h2>Don McLean</h2>
<p><div>A long long time ago <br>
I can still remember how <br>
That music used to make me smile <br>
And I knew if I had my chance <br>
That I could make those people dance <br>
And maybe they'd be happy for a while <br>
But February made me shiver <br>
With every paper I'd deliver <br>
Bad news on the doorstep <br>
I couldn't take one more step <br>
I can't remember if I cried <br>
When I read about his widowed bride <br>
Something touched me deep inside <br>
The day the music died </div>
<span> So <br>
Bye, bye Miss American Pie <br>
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry <br>
And them good ole boys were drinking whiskey and rye <br>
Singin' this'll be the day that I die <br>
This'll be the day that I die <br>
Did you write the book of love <br>
And do you have faith in God above <br>
If the Bible tells you so? <br>
Do you believe in rock and roll? <br>
Can music save your mortalâ€¦  </span>
